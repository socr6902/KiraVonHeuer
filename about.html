        <h1>Atelier</h1>
        
        <p><em>From the French: a workshop or studio, especially of an artist or designer.</em></p>
        
        <p>This atelier makes objects, installations, and experiences that bridge the functional and the contemplative. Everything emerges from the same core questions: What does it mean to make something well? What is the relationship between beauty and use? How do objects carry meaning?</p>
        
        <p>The practice spans multiple modes—collections of editioned objects, site-specific installations, curatorial projects, publications. What unites them is an ethic of making: slow process, material honesty, attention to craft, and a refusal of the false choice between art and utility.</p>
        
        <h2>Process</h2>
        
        <p>Work begins with research. Reading, observing, collecting images and materials. Long periods of looking before making. When objects emerge, they carry this thinking—not as concept imposed on material, but as form arrived at through conversation with process.</p>
        
        <p>Most work is made by hand or involves direct manipulation of material. Metal is cast from hand-carved wax. Ceramics are shaped on the wheel or built by coil. Even when working at larger scales, the hand remains visible. This is intentional. The mark of making is information, not flaw.</p>
        
        <p>Editions are small. Between 15 and 30 pieces. This allows for quality without preciousness. Objects can be owned and used without becoming rarities. They're meant for daily life, not display cases.</p>
        
        <h2>Intention</h2>
        
        <p>The atelier exists because beautiful, well-made things should not be luxuries. Because the everyday deserves as much attention as the ceremonial. Because making can be both a livelihood and a practice of devotion.</p>
        
        <p>This work is not about nostalgia for pre-industrial craft. It's about finding sustainable ways to make in the present. About honoring materials and the people who work them. About building a practice that can continue—economically, ethically, creatively—for decades.</p>
        
        <h2>Studio</h2>
        
        <p>Based in Cornwall, England. The workshop overlooks the Atlantic. This is not decorative geography—the ocean is teacher, collaborator, and constant presence. The work would not exist without it.</p>
