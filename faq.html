        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        
        <h2>Are pieces made to order?</h2>
        <p>Most objects in the collections are made to order within small editions. This ensures quality and allows us to maintain sustainable studio practices. Current lead time is 3–4 weeks.</p>
        
        <h2>Can I commission custom work?</h2>
        <p>We occasionally accept commissions for private clients and institutional projects. <a href="contact.html">Contact us</a> with your inquiry. Please note that commissions require longer lead times and may not always be possible depending on studio capacity.</p>
        
        <h2>Do you offer wholesale or trade pricing?</h2>
        <p>Yes, for qualified galleries, design professionals, and retailers. Please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> with your business information and resale certificate.</p>
        
        <h2>How should I care for my piece?</h2>
        <p>Each object ships with care instructions specific to its materials. Generally: sterling silver develops patina over time—this is natural and beautiful. To restore shine, use a silver polishing cloth. Ceramics and glass should be hand-washed. Textiles should be dry cleaned or hand-washed in cold water.</p>
        
        <h2>Can damaged pieces be repaired?</h2>
        <p>Yes. We believe in repair as both practical necessity and philosophical commitment. Contact us with photos and we'll provide a repair estimate. Most repairs can be completed within 2–3 weeks.</p>
        
        <h2>Are your materials ethically sourced?</h2>
        <p>Yes. We work only with suppliers who can verify ethical sourcing. Our silver is 100% recycled. Stones are sourced from small-scale miners with documented fair labor practices. We prioritize materials with minimal environmental impact and refuse to use any materials linked to exploitation or ecological harm.</p>
        
        <h2>How do I know my size for wearable pieces?</h2>
        <p>Most amulets and pendants are designed to be worn on long chains and don't require sizing. For rings or custom-sized work, we provide sizing guides and can work with you to ensure proper fit. Remakes for sizing are free within the first 30 days.</p>
        
        <h2>Do you ship internationally?</h2>
        <p>Yes, worldwide. Buyers are responsible for any customs duties or taxes.</p>
        
        <h2>Can I visit the studio?</h2>
        <p>Studio visits are by appointment only. We welcome collectors, students, and fellow makers. Please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> to schedule.</p>
